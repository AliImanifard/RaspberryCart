## Necessary explanations
❗❗ This project was created entirely for educational purposes, its information is fake and will not earn any money!! ❗❗

Because this application is not connected to a real server (websites for buying and selling products online) for displaying products, registering users, shopping cart actions, etc., all the data is fake and uses fake store API.

So here it is necessary to thank [Keivan Kaavousi](https://github.com/keikaavousi) for [Fake Store Api](https://github.com/keikaavousi/fake-store-api) who developed with the help of his project, the process of developing the Raspberry Cart application has started!!

In fact, it can be said that all the codes have been fully implemented to communicate with the server, but due to the urgent need for a real API in some topics, the information was inevitably stored in a fake form in the local database. They were recovered when necessary.

Also, many thanks should be given to [Istiaque Ahmed](https://www.figma.com/@istiaqueomi) for designing and building the user interface [Nikovi Ecommerce App UI Design
](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1085575374404058043)!

In fact, it can be said that many inspirations were taken from Istiaque Ahmed's design in this project to finally reach this point.

✅✅✅ But the things that I followed in the development of this application to make it one of the most advanced applications today:
+ MVVM (Model - View - ViewModel) Design Pattern
+ Repository Pattern, which is a design pattern that separates the data layer from the rest of the application.
+ Using Data Source architecture Pattern that separates server data sources from local data sources and provides them to the Repository, which greatly increases performance.
+ Using dependency injection(KOIN), which is a programming technique that makes a class independent of its dependencies. It is achieved by separating the use of an object from its creation. This will help you follow SOLID single responsibility and dependency inversion principles.
+ Using RxJava, which is a library for writing asynchronous and event-driven programs using observable sequences.
+ Using Material3, which is the most up-to-date and optimal design of user interface elements.
+ Using Retrofit, which is a type-safe HTTP client for Android and Java.
+ Using Room, which is a persistent library in Android that allows fluent access to the database by creating an abstract layer over SQLite.
+ along with full of other features...
